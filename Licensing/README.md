LICENSING
=========

The project, as a complete entity, is licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, Version 2.0, or at your option, any later version.

I reserve the right to republish some libraries which I consider to be
modularly independant of the project, but which are being published for the
first time as part of the project, at a later date under a less restrictive
liscense.

*(note: I originally intended to liscense the project under the GPLv3, and
some parts of the source code archive have comments to this effect; I have
since chosen to commit to the GPLv2 or later because of various
potential complications regarding liscense propagation and the linux
kernel.)*

*this is not legal advice, and I am not a lawyer. I am a programmer with
signifigant disdain for legal trolls suppressing the advancement of
knowladge, and I personally believe this liscense to be the best way of
preventing this.*
