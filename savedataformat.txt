serialization format:

size of field...	value field contains
====================================
Header:
sizeof(char16_t)...	byte order mark
sizeof(intptr_t)...	0
sizeof(intptr_t)...	-1
sizeof(intptr_t)...	root pointer
UUID_LENGTH...	game number
MD4_DIGEST_LENGTH...	game seed

Data:
sizeof(intptr_t)...	address the data was loaded at when game was saved
sizeof(size_t)...	length of the next 2 fields, each
	...	the raw datastruct
	...	mask that shows what areas contain a stale pointer

End:
sizeof(intptr_t)...	0

note: no pointers to data not included in the same
	dat file may occur. they must be NULLed on saving.
	to enable persistant data to call state sensitive data,
	a plugin library based on dlsym is included in the savefile
	implementation; it implements referece structs that have
	arguments needed for dlsym as well as a pointer for storing
	the transitory result of the call.
