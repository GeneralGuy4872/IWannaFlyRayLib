<intertwined story/plot details for western subcontinent pending>

you are a human young orphan, who lives on the streets and has taken to a
life of ...questionable means. you have a particular set of skills which
aids you in your "choosen" profession of rogue, many of which you feel
compelled to keep secret; you are exceedingly light, can see well in the 
dark, look young for your age, and, most curiously, can cast weak magic.

humans cannot use magic.

despite being exceptionally agile and fast, your body feels stiff and
clumbsy. nobody knows who your parents were; at least, nobody is willing
to tell you anything useful.

you have heard stories of the lands far beyond the kingdom of <name needed>,
beyond all the others like it, and dream of someday becoming a merchant, or
a sailor, or anything that means you can escape this dying place. but these
things take money; money that has to be spent on food.

before the city was placed under curfew, you found solice in taking
nightime runs along the rooftops. your ability to get in and out of
places silently has earned you a reputation in certain circles.

***

you have been hired to locate a man and bring him to a local gambling hall
owner, for undisclosed reasons. you must complete your contract by the end
of next month.

vagrency is illegal in <name needed>, and if you are found after curfew by
the city guard, you will be sold into slavery. hiding in the catacombs to
avoid detection has worked so far.

the day after tomorrow is the vernal equinox. there will a new year's
festival (with free food) in the town square.
