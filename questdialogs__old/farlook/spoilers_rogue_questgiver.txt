it's the old woman in the cloak.
she comes by your hideout every 
few days to give you food and coin.
is she homeless too?


it's the old woman in the cloak.
she was wearing the cloak to hide
her siren wings!
why was she helping you?
sirens hate humans...


it's the elder's daughter.
you can't pronounce her name.
she took you to her village
when the city guard came to
raid your hideout


it's the elder's daughter.
she's dying...
