You are a human, 21 years of age, the youngest child of a family said to trace back to a hero of the ancestreal war, your older siblings inheriting all of your family's wealth, titles, and land. Knowing this, you have trained since you were a young child and now, having come of age, set off in search of fame and fortune in your own right as a knight errant in the rich and fertile lands of your kin, living by the codes of honor and chivalry.

Your starting alignment is Lawful.
You are at full health
You have 255 gold
You have a bow and 20 steel arrows
You wield a Broadsword and a Heater shield
Humans cannot use magic.
