at the beginning of the second half of the game, the majority of the possible roles
will be at the point where they will need to reach the plane of Entropy before continuing
on to the outer planes. doing so triggers a cutscene.

??? - "Your journey is just beginning, traveler. but where you have sought to
	enter is a dangerous place. I will guide you to a safe waystation, but you must
	find your own way to your destination - and back. you will need to find a ship;
	a most ancient ship once sailed by a would-be hero on an ill-fated voyage. it
	has remained here for such time that the essance and matter that once comprised
	it have seeped back to the prime plane, being gradually replaced by a cold
	mirror of itself. one such as you could use it to return.

	do you think it is still the same ship?"
