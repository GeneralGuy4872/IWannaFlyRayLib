at the beginning of the second half of the game, the majority of the
possible roles will be at the point where they will need to reach the plane
of Entropy before continuing on to the outer planes. doing so triggers a
cutscene.

���[0] - "Your journey is just beginning, traveler. but where you have
	sought to enter is a dangerous place. I will guide you to a safe
	waystation, but you must find your own way to your destination -
	and back. you will need to find a ship; a most ancient ship once
	sailed by a would-be hero on an ill-fated voyage. it has remained
	here for such time that the material that comprises it has seeped
	away, being replaced by magic vaccume particles. one such as you
	could draw their energy to return to your home plane.

	hmmm...

	do you think it is still the same ship?"

>Yes.	>No.	>I don't know...
>Yes and no.	>What??
>"Same" is an illusion.

(answer is irrelevant; the mystery person is gone before
hearing it. the *question* is what's important.

it serves as forshadowing, in-story forshadowing, and
also attempts to place the player in the same mindset as
the character at the given moment, increasing their investment
in the narritive.)
