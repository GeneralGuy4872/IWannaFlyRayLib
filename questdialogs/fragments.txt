gnome - I call it a computational engine. it uses thousands of small
	mechanical parts to store and manipulate data! and as a recent
	improvement, it is powered by... <B><I>Electricity!</>

	...or it will be. A freind of mine, accross the streight, has
	developed a timing mechinism that never needs to be wound. the
	device is based on a simple quartz spell crystal! however, piracy
	accross the streight has increased in recent weeks, and the mail
	has been suspended... I know that you suredly must be busy, but
	could you perhaps fetch it for me?

sourcerer thug - oh, fiesty young street rat, eh? what are you going to do?
	humans can't cast, so unless--
mentor - *snrkt*
thug - ...what are you laughing at, hag?
mentor - <I>oh, nothing. carry on.</>

	*cold open*

(redshirt) - GO TO HELL YOU MONSTERS!!
���[evil] - <fg=red><B>Oh, I've been to hell. <I>I even <U>brought
	some of it back with me</>

elven magic professor - never draw magic until the moment you need it.
	holding it too long will burn you from the inside out; the æthereal
	nature of the energy is believed to destabilize matter native to
	the mundane plane. so draw while you cast; not before.

***

siren magic instructor - it is easy for us to draw and hold magic; take
	advantage of this. always draw enough magic to cast a spell before
	you do so; if you do, your spells will be amplifyed if part of them
	is blocked. it is said that the strongest of us could draw magic
	and hold it indefinately...uhh, but don't try this.

	you might explode.

***

���[0] - Stop. that's not necissarry. you are no longer drawing energy from
	a well, or diverting it from a river. you are the precipace of a
	waterfall, and if you cannot learn to stem the flow soon, you will
	be eroded away by the current.

	once I am sure you arn't a bigger threat than ���[evil], if only
	from your inexperiance, you may leave.

***

���[0] - You're not the first to seek these monsters.

	you know wat they say about the one who fights them...

���[0] - REMEMBER...

*note: all required characters start getting this event halfway through
chapter 2*

***

	*note: once per game, initiated when a required character enters
	the room and triggers the oracle's event. the special version
	of the event is missable, and can only be triggered duing the
	first chapter*

oracle - <fg=cyan><B><I>The endless cycle begun again,
	with it each born anew...accross dimensions,
	echos converge...time repeats...
	will this time be like all the rest? no...
	no, something different...</>

	hmm? when did you walk in?
	*normal dialog start*

***

extra 1 - "<B>Magic</B>" is such a vague, unscientific term...
extra 2 - well, "<I>hyper-cosmic extradimensional currents induced by
	exposing potential differentials in persistant background fields of
	exotic quantum partical reservoirs</I>" is a bit verbose.
extra 1 - <I><U>but it's percise!</>
