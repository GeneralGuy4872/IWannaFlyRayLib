player should awaken in an alley, with no money,
no weapons aside from a shiny copper pipe,
and no guidence other than a note saying
"they are after you-- trust no-one".

upon trying to leave the allyway, they suprise a mugger.
the player kills the mugger with a single attack, who drops
a throwing knife and a picture of the player with the player's
name and "5,000,000,000 credits" written on it
