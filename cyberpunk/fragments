save your game guy - man, my life sucks!
I'm just a nobody from nowhere!
heck, if life was an RPG, I wouldn't even be

the starting area that says "Don't forget to
save your game!"

your shadow - who am I?
I'm everything that you are not.
I'm everything that you've forgot.
I'm everything that you should be--
don't you wish... that you were meâ¸®
