Nighttime, Autumn, full moon.

Overlooking the Draconic fortifications of the
[orogenic belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny)
that subsumes the polar subcontinent, now occupied by sirens. Severe
[tidal forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force) in the
[geologically distant](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Geologica_time_USGS.png)
([astronomically recent](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg))
past from the [LVB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_blue_variable)
[companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) to the
[sun-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_analog) star which the
planet orbits caused massive disruption to the entire
[lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) in this
region; the evidence of this time is in the layers of rock exposed in the
wall.

the LVB companion star is visible in upper left. [on the winter solstice,
it rises just as the sun sets; on the summer solstice, it is behind the
star the planet orbits.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy))

The wall itself is carved into a dormant
[Thrust fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_fault), and the
layers are as follows (top to bottom, I forgot to draw some of them):

- [Pyroclastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_rock) [Tuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff) (*absent from drawing*)
- [Andesite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andesite) (*absent from drawing*)
- [Rhyolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyolite) (*absent from drawing*)
- [Basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt) [Flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava)
- [Columnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_jointing) Basalt
- [Batholithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batholith) [Granite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite) ([salmon pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthoclase))
- [Greenschist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenschist) (*absent from drawing*)
- [Blueschist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueschist)
- [Gniess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gneiss) (*absent from drawing*)

in the upper layers,
[intrusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusive_rock#Structural_types)
of 
[Gabbero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbro)[norite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norite),
Granite, [Diorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorite),
[Syenite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syenite), and 
[Foidolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foidolite) are present
(*but not in the drawing*); at lower
levels, intrusions are of
[Kimberlite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlite) with
[Peridotite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridotite) [Xenoliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenolith)
(and [diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)), or of [Peridotite entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)).

the size of both walls (200m tall, 1500km long; each) makes them 
interesting for scientific study; and terrifying for *several* reasons.

in the present day,
[the dragons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire) are
[all gone](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalWithdrawal)
and
[the sirens](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance) use
the fortifications to defend their
[quiet civilization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage)
from the other
[war-prone](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe)
[mayfly](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived) races;
although,
[they will sometimes tolerate the elves](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter).
