.ini  : settings file (may be changed to a .foorc file if parser can be improved)
.tsv  : player mesurements
.log  : output log
.save : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a plugin compiler program parses:

.tsv|.csv        : float, array of float, vector, array of vector, matrix
.txt             : string literal
.ini             : struct, non-recursive
.sgml|.xml|.json : struct, recursive
.rc              : multiple ini structs

to objects that can be linked into the main build

events can be programmed in C files and compiled seperately

the resultant objects, along with:

.bin|.hex|.dat|.raw : heightmaps

can be specified in a recompiler script that generates a makefile and rebuilds the game to include them

alternatively, the uncompiled files could be parsed by the game at runtime. both routes should be pursued.
