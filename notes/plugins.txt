.ini  : settings file (may be changed to a .foorc file if parser can be improved)
.tsv  : player mesurements
.log  : output log
.save : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a perl script uses an .rc file to generate a makefile that uses awk to parse:

.tsv|.csv : array, fraction, vector, matrix, etc
.ini      : macros, single (non-nested) struct
.rc       : multiple (non-nested) struct, single (FINITEly nested) struct
.json     : single (infinately nested) struct
.xml      : multiple (infinately nested) structs

to C.
another perl script generates a makefile that combines the resultant code with:

.bin|.hex|.dat|.raw : raw binary data
.c                  : event function, skeleton

and the vanilla source to produce the modded game.

a different perl script takes a set of mesurements foo.?sv and a skeleton bar.c and displays it.



.?sv formatting:

foo,bar,quux : a vector

foo	bar	quux : an array

foo	bar
quux	xyzzy : an array of arrays

a,b,c,x	d,e,f,y	g,h,i,z	j,k,l,w : a matrix

technically, [,\t] are interpreted the same and the difference is for readability.
a space is interpreted as part of the value.
