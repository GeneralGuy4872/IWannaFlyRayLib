.c    : C source
.h    : C header
.bas  : BASIC script to emit file(s)

.ini   : settings file (might be changed to a .foorc file)
.dat   : player mesurements
.log   : output log
.save  : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a perl script uses an rc file to generate a makefile that uses awk to parse:

.tsv|.csv|.tab|.dat  : array, fraction, vector, matrix, etc   (dat = single column data)
.ini                 : simple macros, single (non-nested) struct, role switch case
.json                : single (infinately nested) struct
.xml                 : multiple (infinately nested) structs

to C and generates a new init.c file. file syntax is assumed from extention.

another perl script generates a makefile that combines the resultant code with:

.bin|.hex|.raw  : raw binary data (dynamically loaded)
.txt            : blocks of text (for events, must be an eight-dot-three name)
.c              : event function, skeleton and entity generator functions, misc code
.h              : shape macros, misc code

and the patched vanilla source to produce the modded game.

a different perl script takes a set of mesurements foo.?sv and a model bar.c and compiles a program to display it.
