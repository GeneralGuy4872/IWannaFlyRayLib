Far Future plugin interface:

a perl script uses an .rc file to generate a makefile that uses awk to parse:

.tsv|.csv|.dsv  : array, fraction, vector, matrix, etc
.ini            : simple macros, single (non-nested) struct, role switch case
.rc             : multiple (non-nested) struct, single (FINITEly nested) struct, entire role switch table
.json           : single (infinately nested) struct
.xml|.sgml      : multiple (infinately nested) structs

to C and generates a new init.c file. file syntax is assumed from extention.

another perl script generates a makefile that combines the resultant code with:

.bin|.hex|.dat|.raw : raw binary data (dynamically loaded)
.txt                : blocks of text (for events, must be an eight-dot-three name due to fixed length names)
.c                  : event function, skeleton and entity generator functions, misc code
.h                  : shape macros, misc code

and the patched vanilla source to produce the modded game.

a different perl script takes a set of mesurements foo.?sv and a skeleton bar.c and displays it.
