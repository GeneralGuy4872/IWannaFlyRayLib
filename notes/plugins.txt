.ini  : settings file (may be changed to a .foorc file if parser can be improved)
.tsv  : player mesurements
.log  : output log
.save : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a plugin compiler program parses:

.tsv  : array
.csv  : vector
.ini  : macros
.rc   : multiple (non-recursive) struct
.json : single (recursive) struct
.xml  : multiple (recursive) structs

to objects that can be linked into the main build

events can be programmed in C files using some API and compiled seperately

the resultant objects, along with:

.bin|.hex|.dat|.raw : raw binary data

can be specified in a recompiler script that generates a makefile and rebuilds the game to include them

alternatively, the uncompiled files could be parsed by the game at runtime. both routes should be pursued.
