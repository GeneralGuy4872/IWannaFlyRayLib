.ini  : settings file (may be changed to a .foorc file if parser can be improved)
.tsv  : player mesurements
.log  : output log
.save : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a perl script uses an .rc file to generate a makefile that uses awk to parse:

.tsv  : array, fraction, vector, matrix, etc
.ini  : simple macros, single (non-nested) struct
.rc   : multiple (non-nested) struct, single (FINITEly nested) struct
.json : single (infinately nested) struct
.xml  : multiple (infinately nested) structs

to C. file syntax is assumed from extention.

another perl script generates a makefile that combines the resultant code with:

.bin|.hex|.dat|.raw : raw binary data
.c                  : event function, skeleton, misc code
.h                  : shape macros, misc code

and the vanilla source to produce the modded game.

a different perl script takes a set of mesurements foo.?sv and a skeleton bar.c and displays it.
