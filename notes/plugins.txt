.c    : C source

.tmp  : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a perl script uses an rc file to generate a makefile that uses awk to parse:

.tsv|.csv|.tab|.dat  : array, fraction, vector, matrix, etc   (dat = single column data)
.ini                 : simple macros, single (non-nested) struct, role switch case
.json                : single (infinately nested) struct
.xml                 : multiple (infinately nested) structs

to C and generates a new init.c file. file syntax is assumed from extention.

another perl script generates a makefile that combines the resultant code with:

.r8   : heightmap
.txt  : blocks of text (for events, must be an eight-dot-three name)
.hex  : non-text char array (r8 is a synonym)
.bin  : binary data
.c    : event function, skeleton and entity generator functions, misc code
.h    : shape macros, misc code
.o    : object file (discouraged)

and the vanilla source to produce the modded game.

a different perl script takes a set of mesurements foo.? and a model bar.c and compiles a program to display it.
