.c  : C source
.h  : C header

.ini   : settings file (might be changed to a .*rc file)
.dat   : player mesurements
.log   : output log
.tmp   : temporary file
.save  : save file

Far Future plugin interface:

a perl script uses an rc file to parse:

.tsv|.csv|.tab|.dat  : array, fraction, vector, matrix, etc   (dat = single column data)
.ini                 : single (non-nested) struct, role switch case
.json                : single (infinately nested) struct, role switch case
.xml                 : multiple (infinately nested) structs, role switch case

to C files using a small set of API commands:

(initial syntax outline)

COMMAND= param:"string" param:/path/to/file.ext param:7 bool !bool tern !tern -tern ...
COMMAND_FF=/path/to/file.ext
MACRO=/path/to/file.ini /path/to/file.ini ...

 - a path starts with [~/.] and must not contain spaces. file system may be case sensitive, extension recognition is not
 - Decimal is assumed. Non-decimal numbers must be non-negative and whole. decimal numbers should omit leading zeros for performance reasons
 - Non-decimal numbers may be in motorola notation: $ is hex, @ is octal, % is binary; or in common notation: 0x is hex, 0o is octal, 0b is binary
 - linked file syntax is assumed from both context and extension; if context and extension are contradictory, an error is generated
 - most fields will accept a literal string by passing an argument in single quotes. escaping the first quote with a prime passes the quotes as well.)
 - another file may be inserted at any point outside of a field using <path/to/file>

another perl script generates a makefile, combining the vanilla source, the generated files, and other specified files:

.r8   : heightmap
.txt  : blocks of text (for events, must be an eight-dot-three name)
.hex  : non-text char array (r8 is a synonym)
.c    : event function, skeleton and entity generator functions, misc code
.h    : shape macros, misc code

generates a sed script to add #include lines and generate a default config file, and then compile the modded game.

(rc syntax tbd)

a different perl script takes a set of mesurements foo.? and a model bar.c and compiles a program to display it.
a helper program can generate mesurement files (ascii .dat format) for models.
