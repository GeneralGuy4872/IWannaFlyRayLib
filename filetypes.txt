.c	C of some description
.cc	C++
.m	Objective C
.mm	Objective C++

.inc	modularized code
.inl	inline functions

.h	C or C++ header
.h_	C only header
.struct C struct definitions
.def	C preprocessor macro file

.hh	C++ only header
.cclass	C++ class header
.tmpl	C++ template header

.hm	Objective C header
.hmm	Objective C++ header

.*.m4	must be preprocessed with the M4 macro processor
.*.nbsp	must be preprocessed with the command `tr -d '\xff'`

.txt	text
.curses	bytecode to be executed by curses.

.dat	a data dump object. savefiles are currently unarchived directories,
	but may be changed. contains a single navigational database, frozen
	as a key-value store, using the current addresses as *arbitrary*
	keys. new addresses are generated upon reloading.

.bin	a page of data; is mmaped to an unsigned char array and backed by a
	file. the address of the array in memory is irrelevant, the data is
	accessed by [offset]. chunk voxel data uses this format; they are
	32^3 voxels and use 15 bits of address space.

the combination of bin files and dat files should be useable to restore all
relevant state data.

possible build scripts for the project,
once it reaches the existential threshold:
build.sh	makefile	CMakeLists.txt
