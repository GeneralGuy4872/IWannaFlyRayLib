.c	regular C
.cc	C++
.cpp	C++, depracated ambiguous notation

.cnode	modular C snippet to be #include-ed
.ccnode	modular C++ snippet to be #include-ed
.clist	modular C snippet to be #include-ed consisting of a large array
	(provides seperation of large translation units, to make wading
	through code simpler. will also facilitate rapid prototyping on
	scales smaller than can be justifyed by dynamic linking for the
	course of the alpha build)

.h	C or C++ header
.hh	C++ only header
.H	header needed for both compiling and linking

.txt	text
.nfo	text containing ansi strings
	(many text editors do not like SGR codes.)

.dumproutines.*
	the routines used to save an object
.dat	a binary dump of an object.
	dumps are constructed using an internal system based off file
	offset, uuids, and a priority queue. this enables data that relys
	on pointers to be relocatable without the use of a java-style VM.

.tar	a tar archive
