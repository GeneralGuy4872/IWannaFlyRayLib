.c	regular C
.cc	C++

.inc	modular code snippet to be #include-ed
	these files contain large amounts of data

.h	C or C++ header
.struct C struct definitions
.def	C preprocessor macro file

.hh	C++ only header
.cclass	C++ class header
.tmpl	C++ template header

.*.m4	must be preprocessed with the M4 macro processor

.txt	text
.curses	bytecode to be executed by curses.

.dat	a data dump object. savefiles are currently unarchived directories,
	but may be changed. contains a single navigational database, frozen
	as a key-value store, using the current addresses as *arbitrary*
	keys. new addresses are generated upon reloading.

.bin	an array of contiguous data; is read to and from an unsigned char
	array of uint's of the same width. the address of the array
	in memory is irrelevant.
	chunk voxel data uses this format; they are 32*32*32 voxels
	and use a 15-bit address.

the combination of bin files and dat files should be useable to restore all
relevant state data.

*.man.* 	a Linux manpage
*.mdoc.*	a NetBSD manpage

*.m(an|doc).3iwf	a manpage on the api
*.m(an|doc).5iwf	a manpage on file formats
*.m(an|doc).6	the engine's manpage
*.m(an|doc).6iwf	a game package's manpage
*.m(an|doc).7	the engine's automata layout

*.texinfo	plugin technical documentation,
		lore reference materials for players and devs

possible build scripts for the project,
once it reaches the existential threshold:
build.sh	makefile	CMakeLists.txt
