after the first quarter of the game, partys can be merged. doing so
requires that both games be in the same global chapter, that the game is
saved in a "Designated Area", that 2 individuals are not duplicated, and
that the subspell "Wormhole - Summon Party" is known by a member of the
party to be merged into.

***

spells are called as thunks based on a dispatch table taking argc/argv.

***

save files are tar bz2 files. the file is extracted to tmpfs during
gameplay

***

chunk buffer is 64 chunks in a fifo. the nearest chunks are always kept
in the front 27 slots; others are allowed to fall further and further
back until falling off the end, being synced to tmpfs, then unloaded.
