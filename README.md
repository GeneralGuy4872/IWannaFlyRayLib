A Nearly Realtime RPG Engine written in C and C++
-------------------------------------------------

At this point, I've learned a bunch of stuff on both the programming and
metaprogramming* level, and I think I have a pretty good idea of how to
move forward. This project was started primarily as a self-study
opportunity, and it's been a fun journey.

I have now settled on a language, an overall structure, some libraries,
and a ui/gameplay style. from here, I do not forsee any further false
starts and hope to have smooth(ish) sailing through to a working alpha!

despite using C++, I have decided that to maximise the utility of the
engine, I want the public API to be in plain C. namespaces will be
seperated by <CODE>___</CODE>

*note: as I've been learning, one of the things I've been teaching myself
has also been the git system; as a result, instead of branching the repo
at two specific "flag day" points of development, I *forked* it instead.
Mistakes were made. If you want to see these relics (you really don't),
I will leave them as-is.
