Will add other systems if I get better hardware, Arch 64 being paramount amoungst them

Right now my dev systems consist of a Netburst Celeron, a K7 with no ethernet (has rj45 and rs232 instead), and an early C2D laptop that only runs P6 kernels; all of which date from between the late 90s and mid 2000s with full compliment of parallel-PCI expansion bus, IDE drives, and "legacy" ports on the towers. (the k7 actually has an EISA slot for the graphics card!)
