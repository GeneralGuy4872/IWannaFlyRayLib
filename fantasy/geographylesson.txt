Court aid - You've never left the <Starting City>, eh? well, let me give
	you a quick run down of our situation. we've got the <Yellow Empire>
	and it's vassals bordering us to our southeast, the <Red Empire>
	and it's client states to the west, and the <Blue Empire> to the
	south; all of whom are totalitarion dystopias with no regard for
	the wellbeing of the people. ever since we declared our little
	city-state to be soverign, well... they started out all trying to
	capture it at the same time; next thing you know, they're all
	fighting eachother instead. by the time they get that all sorted
	out, we got to thinking, we're right in the shadow of the siren
	lands, why not ask them for help?

[1] - the elders were hesitant at first, but it's been very benificial for
	both of us. we've had a safe place to come over the wall and launch
	covert operations, and they have protection from any enemies that
	might mistake them for an easy target.

Court aid - and your people have also been eager to trade with us for
	fruits and spices

[1] - well, there's certain things that just won't grow in the polar
	mountains... and they all taste so good!
