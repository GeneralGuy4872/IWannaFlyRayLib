the language of the sirens is vast and complex, combining vocalization of
the larnix and syrnix. few other species can understand it, and fewer still
can actually speak it.

it has two written forms: a complex dictation form, and a ‶simplified″
academic form. the dictation form is most commonly used, and records the
inflection of the words, as well as their dialectal pronunceation; there is
no standardized spelling. the academic form was invented to fix this, and
records generalized phonemes instead of exact sounds. the newer academic
form has gained universal acceptance in applications where the text is not
a proxy for a person's words, but presents it's own information; i.e. in a
novel, it has become standard practice to use the academic form for the
words of a dispassionate narrator, while continuing to use the dictation
form for dialouge spoken by characters. using the opposite form of writing
can be used artistically to invoke a response, although when done by
mistake it usually invokes mockery.
