the list of characters will likely change quite a bit between now and a
playable alpha, so I'll give a general overview.

some party characters will have their personality entirely decided by the
player; others will have fixed dialog. for the majority of the beginning of
the game, they are litteraly scattered all over the world; eventually, they
all meet up in the siren capital; and then the party will be able to be
split and re-merged at the player's discretion. plot-related events will
cause certain characters to become involentarily seperated from the party
from time to time, but otherwise the entire cast can be assumed to be in
communication via long range telepathy.
