thief, chapter 2, dream
=======================

[0] -	You're asking yourself the wrong question.

	In addition to psionics, humans can, in fact, cast basic spells;
	several notable heros have done so. but doing so is _always_ fatal.
	it is a matter of biology; the exotic energy causes too much damage
	to a frail human body.

	not only have you cast several high level spells of particularly
	complex construction, but because of your lack of training, you
	have done so in such a way that would bring an experianced elvan
	battlecaster to their knees in agony...and you are none the worse
	for wear.

	why do you suppose that is?
