CHUNK LAYOUT
============

randomly generated chunks must be packed into a cuboid area; this creates
problems as the game's world is sphereical. since I have no dillusions that
the graphics of the game will be stellar, this issue will be solved by
creating hard seams between areas, eleminating the projection issues
entirely. these will slightly resembal a similar cop-out that will be
employed to avoid rendering overlapping chunks.
