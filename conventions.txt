the perferred method of API function error checking is by ERRNO, in
combination with an "IMPLICIT" (int) return value of 0 for no error, 1 for
a mild error, and -1 for severe error. this matches the convention of most
C standard library and nCurses functions, but not C++ functions.

critical errors will exit, abort, or raise a signal as appropriate.

bogon checking, to mitigate database corruption, will use assertions.
example: assert(localfoo = *originalfoo)
