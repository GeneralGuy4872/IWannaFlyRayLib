NOTE: NOT READY FOR COMPILATION

a .ch file is a code header file, and containes code that must
be in the same translation unit as the .c file they are used in.
these files contain volatile functions. each .ch file should
correspond to a single blackbox-like abstraction layer.

efforts will be made to move to using the linker rather than the
proprocessor to combine files, however various sources indicate
that this would be a pessimization in most of my use cases.

files that do not require access to a global variable will
use the linker; files that do will use preprocessor transclusion
via a .ch file

all details are subject to change, based on compiler tinkering.
