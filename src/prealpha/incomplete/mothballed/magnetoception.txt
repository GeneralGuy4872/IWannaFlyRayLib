Magnetoception:
- initialize a discreet vector space with
  south→north vectors of magnitude 0.5
  (or some other value 0.25 ≤ real ≤ 0.65)
- calculate a vector at each intergal point
  on the main grid for each dipole, and mean
  the value into the vector at that coordinate
- render each vector in red, and its negative
  in light blue.

B_r = 2M sin lat/r^3
B_lat = -M cos lat/r^3

  (non-dipole sources will be modeled as
  dipoles. this is a game engine, not a
  scientific calculator.)
