sing a song of sixpence
a pocket full of lies
now's come the time to set them streight
and make broken wings to fly

once more into the breach,
how high will one mere mortal reach?
what's past is prolouge, what's done is done;
but nothing new happens under the sun;
know your enemy, know your history.
know your self;
know that you know nothing.

fire and iron, blood, pain,
lightning, thunder, and rain;
paid cost
return what was lost;
powers of stricken name,
storm of ancient fates denied,
twice upon a battlecry--
ashes! ashes!
...they all. fall. down.
