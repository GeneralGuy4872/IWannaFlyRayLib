chairelf - You have all been summoned here to discuss a request for
military aid from the <nation to the south>. You have had time to speak
with those you represent. What say you?
delegate from <south border area> - I myself am alarmed, but my people
cannot be persuaded during this famine. however; myself and my 2 guards
can accompany the army to my borders, after which I will send my guards
with the force
mayor of the capital - I shall do the same, but the famine has
reached even here, and riots are breaking out over food. I could not
conduct a vote on the matter, and without the authority of my people,
must abstain.
delagate from <western port> - we have our own troubles; privateers from
the ork empire have begun harassing merchant shipments. I havn't any troops
to spare.
*concerned grunts*
chairelf - we will add these developments to the schedual. and you?
delagate from <eastern agrarian plains> - nay. none of this concerns us.
in fact, why should any of us get involved at all, in these trying times?
delagate from <west> - it is the people's decision, not <I>yours</I>.
chairelf - remain civil. the esteemed delagate from <east> would not risk
repeating the grave misconduct of their predascessor, would he?
delagate from <east> - <I>why, I am offended at the very notion¬</I>
delagate from <mountains further east, border> - there have been certain
...umm, developments... that have threatened us as well. we can provide
supplies, including ampel food, but no soldiers. we will attempt a
rendezous at the southern border.
mayor - (ampel food?...)
delagate from <north; you are standing with them> -
	I can provide 4 soldiers: 3 archers and a paladin.
	valiant soldiers from our small village.
entering siren - then you seem to be in need of a caster.
//the meeting falls into disarray, footnote 1
1: delagate from <west> - ...erhm... how does this matter effect you,
half a world away in the polar mountains?
2: delagate from <eastern mountains> - (chairelf, might I have a word after
this... <I>whatEVER this is</I>... is over?)
1: siren - only curious¬
3: mayor - (should we be concerned that an <I>ancient</I> finds this matter
a curiosity?)
3: delagate from <south> - (mayhaps...)
2: chairelf - (see me in my quarters... ... ...this is quite a mess,
isn't it⸮)
4: chairelf - May we have order? Can I--
1: delagate from <north> - I am sure your aid would be appriciated.
4: chairelf - I said... ugh, forget it. this meeting is ajouned.
