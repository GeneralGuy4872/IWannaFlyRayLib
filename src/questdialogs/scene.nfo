[3;36mLong ago, in times of mythâ€¦[23;0m

[93mA [1;3mGreat Storm[21;22;23;24m descended upon the land.
A storm so terrible that even those who [3mdwelled beyond the veil[23m
feared it's power. it threatened to destroy [3mall the realms[23m, and
all seemed powerless to stop it.

However, the [3mheros of the world[23m, aided by the [3mmasters of the
elements[23m and the [3mguardians of the planes[23m, sealed the storm
away for one million years, in the [3mvoid of the unworthy[23m.

Today, there is a [1;3mgreat disturbance[21;22;23;24m in magic,
as the seals fade and the storm rises againâ€¦[23;0m
