(*if an evil player tries to enter a Siren village,
they recieve this warning. if they ignore it, they
are smitten. this applies to lawful-* or
chaotic-neutral orcs and humans as well.
the sirens are constantly at war with both
over their precious metal mines, and thus
consider them to be more inclined to evil
than other races.*)
