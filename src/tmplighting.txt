stopgap lighting mesure

get spherical coordinate from light to quarry

cast a ray directly from the light to the quarry.

if it does not hit, cast a 32x32 grid of rays
in a moore curve, spaced by 1 degree and centered
on the initial ray.

cull if none of these hit.

imperfect solution, but currently
the graphics library provides no
built-in lighting for opengl-mesa
1.1 platforms.
