***Where's all the stuff‽‽‽***
==============================

this is the "clean" branch; only finished work lives here. the devel branch
(the messy one) has lots of code that is unfinished, and is primarily built
from the bottom up. this branch grows from the top down.

once prealpha is over, and the alpha phase begins (which I will decide
arbitrarily at such point as enough of the game's features are implemented
that people can start to get an accurate feel of it), this branch will
be periodically forked for major and minor version numbers and major
revisions (but not typical revisions or patches, and never until there is
a newer version).
