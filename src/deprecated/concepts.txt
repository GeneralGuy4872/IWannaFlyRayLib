the event loop is implemented in Object styled C with some small C++
subsystems. it is based on the dlfcn library. the loop is arranged as
a circular singly linked list, with each element capible of building
a stack of queued frames; after a frame is done executing, any queued
frames are shunted to be executed after it until the stack is empty;
this data layout resembles a wooden crown gear. the function pointer
is of type «int(f*)(unsigned argc,void *argv[])», and is called via
dlsym or, if specifyed to be avalible, dlfunc.

this could be changed to an angelscript engine, where
dlfunc(«module»,«symbol») is replaced by
engine->GetModule(«module»)->GetFunctionByDecl(«symbol»).

the commandline is implemented with angelscript. actions use underlying
C++ objects that define the capibilities of each race/species; each
command calls a method on the object for that species/class. the method
in question may do something expected, something unexpected, produce an
error message, or produce a silly message.
