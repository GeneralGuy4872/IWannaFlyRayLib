TIMED EVENTS
============

the game may have timed events.
these events may expire after a certain in-game date.

critical plot-important events should not be missable timed events;
they may be annual, or renewable, however.

many events will be dependant only on the chapter and prerequisites.
the chapter update events themselves should never be timed.

there will be some mechinism in the game to skip over large amounts of
time, in case an annual event is missed. This can be done anywhere you
can properly save.

timing is also important for merging parties; the parties must both be at
the rendezus on the same day. (while splitting parties is ardous for the
player, merging parties is ardous for the engine.)
