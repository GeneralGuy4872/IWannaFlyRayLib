- Redo chunk renderer (*AGAIN*)
  - cache all 26 border chunk addresses
    - colliding with an edge that connects to address 0 deals void damage
      and imparts a force of 10 gees on the player in a direction
      perpindicular to the interface (handled by the function that
      re-alignes the global coordinate system when chunk boundries are
      crossed)
  - store chunk priority in case of two chunks being rendered in the same
    space
    - the interface to the chunk that is not rendered is is blocked by a
      flat quad with an opaque ripple texture
    - priority is only relevant between chunks with the same taxicab norm
      from octant 0
    - a negative priority chunk is a room boundry, and uses a different
      ripple texture. the chunk is never loaded, and crossing the boundry
      causes a hard reload of all world-related engine state.
