SOLID BODY (NOT ELASTIC) FOR PLAYER

---

Drop voxel-style terrain use geom-style terrain and offload live
organization to Irrlicht; static data file for a geom is:

unsigned char : red
unsigned char : green
unsigned char : blue
unsigned char : alpha
unsigned char : metallic
unsigned char : softness
unsigned char : lightsource
unsigned q16.16 : size x
unsigned q16.16 : size y
unsigned q16.16 : size z
unsigned char : x resolution
unsigned char : y resolution
unsigned char : z resolution
unsigned q16.16 [x res][y res]
unsigned q16.16 [x res][z res]
unsigned q16.16 [y res][z res]

data file is read into memory as needed just like a texture would be

---

characters and entities should display as sprites for now (set of 24); low-
poly hitbox can be added
